now as normal user from terminal:
ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*
or
ls -l /dev/ttyACM*
you will get something like:
crw-rw---- 1 root uucp 188, 0 5 apr 23.01 ttyUSB0
or
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 0 5 apr 23.01 ttyACM0
The "0" might be a different number, or multiple entries might be returned. In the first case the data we need is "uucp", in the second "dialout" (is the group owner of the file.
Now we just need to add our user to the group:
usermod -a -G group-name username
where group-name is the data found before, and username is your linux user name. You will need to log out and in again for this change to take effect.
